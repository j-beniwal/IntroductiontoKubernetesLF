# Chapter 9. Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control #

## Introduction and Learning Objectives ##

### Introduction ###

Every API request reaching the API server has to go through several control stages before being accepted by the server and acted upon. In this chapter, we will learn about the Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control stages of the Kubernetes API access control. 

### Learning Objectives ###

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
 
* Discuss the authentication, authorization, and access control stages of the
* Kubernetes API access.
* Understand the different kinds of Kubernetes users.
* Explore the different modules for authentication and authorization.

## Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control ##

### Authentication, Authorization, and Admission Control - Overview ###

To access and manage Kubernetes resources or objects in the cluster, we need to access a specific API endpoint on the API server. Each access request goes through the following access control stages:

* Authentication
  Logs in a user.

* Authorization
  Authorizes the API requests submitted by the authenticated user.

* Admission Control
  Software modules that validate and/or modify user requests based.

The following image depicts the above stages:

### Authentication I ###

Kubernetes does not have an object called user, nor does it store usernames or other related details in its object store. However, even without that, Kubernetes can use usernames for the [Authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/) phase of the API access control, and to request logging as well. 

Kubernetes supports two kinds of [users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#users-in-kubernetes):

* Normal Users
  They are managed outside of the Kubernetes cluster via independent services like User/Client Certificates, a file listing usernames/passwords, Google accounts, etc.
* Service Accounts
  Service Accounts allow in-cluster processes to communicate with the API server to perform various operations. Most of the Service Accounts are created automatically via the API server, but they can also be created manually. The Service Accounts are tied to a particular Namespace and mount the respective credentials to communicate with the API server as Secrets.

If properly configured, Kubernetes can also support [anonymous requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#anonymous-requests), along with requests from Normal Users and Service Accounts. [User impersonation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation) is also supported allowing a user to act as another user, a helpful feature for administrators when troubleshooting authorization policies.

### Authentication II ###

For authentication, Kubernetes uses a series of [authentication modules](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies):

* X509 Client Certificates
  To enable client certificate authentication, we need to reference a file containing one or more certificate authorities by passing the --client-ca-file=SOMEFILE option to the API server. The certificate authorities mentioned in the file would validate the client certificates presented by users to the API server. A demonstration video covering this topic can be found at the end of this chapter.

* Static Token File
  We can pass a file containing pre-defined bearer tokens with the --token-auth-file=SOMEFILE option to the API server. Currently, these tokens would last indefinitely, and they cannot be changed without restarting the API server.

* Bootstrap Tokens
  Tokens used for bootstrapping new Kubernetes clusters.

* Service Account Tokens
  Automatically enabled authenticators that use signed bearer tokens to verify requests. These tokens get attached to Pods using the ServiceAccount Admission Controller, which allows in-cluster processes to talk to the API server.

* OpenID Connect Tokens
  OpenID Connect helps us connect with OAuth2 providers, such as Azure Active Directory, Salesforce, and Google, to offload the authentication to external services.

* Webhook Token Authentication
  With Webhook-based authentication, verification of bearer tokens can be offloaded to a remote service.

* Authenticating Proxy
  Allows for the programming of additional authentication logic. 

We can enable multiple authenticators, and the first module to successfully authenticate the request short-circuits the evaluation. To ensure successful user authentication, we should enable at least two methods: the service account tokens authenticator and one of the user authenticators. 

### Authorization I ###

After a successful authentication, users can send the API requests to perform different operations. Here, these API requests get [authorized](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/) by Kubernetes using various authorization modules, that allow or deny the requests.

Some of the API request attributes that are reviewed by Kubernetes include user, group, extra, Resource, Namespace, or API group, to name a few. Next, these attributes are evaluated against policies. If the evaluation is successful, then the request is allowed, otherwise it is denied. Similar to the Authentication step, Authorization has multiple modules, or authorizers. More than one module can be configured for one Kubernetes cluster, and each module is checked in sequence. If any authorizer approves or denies a request, then that decision is returned immediately. 

### Authorization II ###

Authorization modes (Part 1):

* Node
  Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode which specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelets. It authorizes the kubelet's read operations for services, endpoints, or nodes, and writes operations for nodes, pods, and events. For more details, please review the [Node authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/).

* Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
  With the ABAC authorizer, Kubernetes grants access to API requests, which combine policies with attributes. In the following example, user student can only read Pods in the Namespace lfs158.

    {
    "apiVersion": "abac.authorization.kubernetes.io/v1beta1",
    "kind": "Policy",
    "spec": {
        "user": "student",
        "namespace": "lfs158",
        "resource": "pods",
        "readonly": true
    }
    }

To enable ABAC mode, we start the API server with the --authorization-mode=ABAC option, while specifying the authorization policy with --authorization-policy-file=PolicyFile.json. For more details, please review the [ABAC authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/).

* Webhook
  In Webhook mode, Kubernetes can request authorization decisions to be made by third-party services, which would return true for successful authorization, and false for failure. In order to enable the Webhook authorizer, we need to start the API server with the --authorization-webhook-config-file=SOME_FILENAME option, where SOME_FILENAME is the configuration of the remote authorization service. For more details, please see the [Webhook mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/). 

### Authorization III ###

Authorization modes (Part 2):

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  In general, with RBAC we regulate the access to resources based on the Roles of individual users. In Kubernetes, multiple Roles can be attached to subjects like users, service accounts, etc. While creating the Roles, we restrict resource access by specific operations, such as create, get, update, patch, etc. These operations are referred to as verbs.

In RBAC, we can create two kinds of Roles:

Role
A Role grants access to resources within a specific Namespace.

ClusterRole
A ClusterRole grants the same permissions as Role does, but its scope is cluster-wide.

A ClusterRole grants the same permissions as Role does, but its scope is cluster-wide.

In this course, we will focus on the first kind, Role. Below you will find an example:

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
    namespace: lfs158
    name: pod-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

The manifest defines a pod-reader role, which has access only to read the Pods of lfs158 Namespace. Once the role is created, we can bind it to users with a RoleBinding object.

There are two kinds of RoleBindings:

* RoleBinding
  It allows us to bind users to the same namespace as a Role. We could also refer a ClusterRole in RoleBinding, which would grant permissions to Namespace resources defined in the ClusterRole within the RoleBindingâ€™s Namespace.

* ClusterRoleBinding
  It allows us to grant access to resources at a cluster-level and to all Namespaces.

In this course, we will focus on the first kind, RoleBinding. Below, you will find an example:

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
    name: pod-read-access
    namespace: lfs158
    subjects:
    - kind: User
    name: student
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
    kind: Role
    name: pod-reader
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

The manifest defines a bind between the pod-reader Role and the student user, to restrict the user to only read the Pods of the lfs158 Namespace.

To enable the RBAC mode, we start the API server with the --authorization-mode=RBAC option, allowing us to dynamically configure policies. For more details, please review the [RBAC mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). 

### Admission Control ###

[Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) are used to specify granular access control policies, which include allowing privileged containers, checking on resource quota, etc. We force these policies using different admission controllers, like ResourceQuota, DefaultStorageClass, AlwaysPullImages, etc. They come into effect only after API requests are authenticated and authorized.

To use admission controls, we must start the Kubernetes API server with the --enable-admission-plugins, which takes a comma-delimited, ordered list of controller names:

    --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,ResourceQuota,PodSecurityPolicy,DefaultStorageClass

Kubernetes has some admission controllers enabled by default. For more details, please review the l[ist of Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do). 

Kubernetes admission control can also be implemented though custom plugins, for a [Dynamic Admission Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) method. These plugins are developed as extensions and run as admission webhooks. 

### Authentication and Authorization Demo Guide ###

This exercise guide assumes the following environment, which by default uses the certificate and key from /var/lib/minikube/certs/, and RBAC mode for authorization:

* Minikube v1.13.1
* Kubernetes v1.19.2
* Docker 19.03.12-ce

This exercise guide was prepared for the video demonstration following on the next page. 

Start Minikube:

    $ minikube start

View the content of the kubectl client's configuration manifest, observing the only context minikube and the only user minikube, created by default:

    $ kubectl config view

Create lfs158 namespace:

    $ kubectl create namespace lfs158

Create the rbac directory and cd into it:

    $ mkdir rbac
    $ cd rbac/

Create a private key for the student user with openssl tool, then create a certificate signing request for the student user with openssl tool:

    ~/rbac$ openssl genrsa -out student.key 2048
    ~/rbac$ openssl req -new -key student.key -out student.csr -subj "/CN=student/O=learner"

Create a YAML manifest for a certificate signing request object, and save it with a blank value for the request field: 

    ~/rbac$ vim signing-request.yaml

    apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CertificateSigningRequest
    metadata:
        name: student-csr
    spec:
        groups:
        - system:authenticated
        request: <assign encoded value from next cat command>
        signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
        usages:
        - digital signature
        - key encipherment
        - client auth

View the certificate, encode it in base64, and assign it to the request field in the signing-request.yaml file:

    ~/rbac$ cat student.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n','%'

    ~/rbac$ vim signing-request.yaml    // and add the previous generated key.

Create the certificate signing request object, then list the certificate signing request objects. It shows a pending state:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl create -f signing-request.yaml

    ~/rbac$ kubectl get csr

Approve the certificate signing request object, then list the certificate signing request objects again. It shows both approved and issued states:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl certificate approve student-csr
    ~/rbac$ kubectl get csr

Extract the approved certificate from the certificate signing request, decode it with base64 and save it as a certificate file. Then view the certificate in the newly created certificate file:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl get csr student-csr -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 --decode > student.crt
    ~/rbac$ cat student.crt

Configure the kubectl client's configuration manifest with the student user's credentials by assigning the key and certificate: 

    ~/rbac$ kubectl config set-credentials student --client-certificate=student.crt --client-key=student.key

Create a new context entry in the kubectl client's configuration manifest for the student user, associated with the lfs158 namespace in the minikube cluster:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl config set-context student-context --cluster=minikube --namespace=lfs158 --user=student

View the contents of the kubectl client's configuration manifest again, observing the new context entry student-context, and the new user entry student:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl config view

While in the default minikube context, create a new deployment in the lfs158 namespace:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl -n lfs158 create deployment nginx --image=nginx:alpine

From the new context student-context try to list pods. The attempt fails because the student user has no permissions configured for the student-context:

    ~/rbac$ kubectl --context=student-context get pods

The following steps will assign a limited set of permissions to the student user in the student-context. 

Create a YAML configuration manifest for a pod-reader Role object, which allows only get, watch, list actions in the lfs158 namespace against pod objects. Then create the role object and list it from the default minikube context, but from the lfs158 namespace:

    ~/rbac$ vim role.yaml

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: pod-reader
      namespace: lfs158
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

    ~/rbac$ kubectl create -f role.yaml
    ~/rbac$ kubectl -n lfs158 get roles

Create a YAML configuration manifest for a rolebinding object, which assigns the permissions of the pod-reader Role to the student user. Then create the rolebinding object and list it from the default minikube context, but from the lfs158 namespace:

    ~/rbac$ vim rolebinding.yaml

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: pod-read-access
      namespace: lfs158
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: student
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: pod-reader
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

    ~/rbac$ kubectl create -f rolebinding.yaml 

    ~/rbac$ kubectl -n lfs158 get rolebindings

Now that we have assigned permissions to the student user, we can successfully list pods from the new context student-context.

    ~/rbac$ kubectl --context=student-context get pods
